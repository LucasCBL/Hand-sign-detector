# Hand-sign-detector
This was a hand sign/gesture detector made in c++ using openCv that used hand colour to extract it from
the background and then made a convex hull around it, which was then used to "manually" 
(using custom algorythms instead of AI) detect hand signs

This was a project made for the SIPC class in the University of La Laguna
